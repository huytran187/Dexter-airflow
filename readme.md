Python = 3.10.8
Beginning an apache airflow project to get experience first hand with creating pipelines, that will continue to be relevant. Deciding what api I want to use to build with and gather data from. Trying to figure out where to begin or what api I want to utilize for this project. May use a weather api, maybe music, maybe add ML capabilities if I get that far. Will be basing project on python, may try to somehow grow this into kafka or begin another project with kafka. That project may scrap and search for a key word on a website and create events based off this. 
Created a branch labeled api-learn for learning how to call apis. Once I feel comfortable with this I will then begin to intergrate more features. As of 11-25-2022 the program will simply just ask the user for a city and then show the results for that city.

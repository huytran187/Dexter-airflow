Beginning an apache airflow project to get experience first hand with creating pipelines, that will continue to be relevant. Deciding what api I want to use to build with and gather data from. Will be basing project on python, may try to somehow grow this into kafka or begin another project with kafka. That project may scrap and search for a key word on a website and create events based off this.
